## System Requirements

* [git][git] v2.14.1 or greater
* [npm][npm] v5.6.0 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```
git --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

follow the following instructions.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/kayongopique/sampleapi-react-redux.git
cd sampleapi-react-redux
npm insatll 
```
This should install the packages in package.json file.This may take a few minutes.



## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application.



## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```
